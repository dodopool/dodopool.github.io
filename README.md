# Let's solve Sudoku!

This website allows users to solve sudoku puzzles, which are fun to solve and are a great way to enjoy free time. 

## Technologies used

I used the following technologies to create this website:

- ✅ `HTML`: HyperText Markup Language for creating the backbone of the homepage.
- ✅ `CSS`: Cascading StyleSheet for tweaking the website design.
- ✅ [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): For the buttons used and website design. 
- ✅ `JavaScript`: The code that solves the Sudoku puzzle was written in JavaScript. 

## How does this work? 

The code uses backtracking to solve the Sudoku problem. Backtracking is a method of trying out possible solutions to a problem by performing trial-and-error. More on backtracking can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking). 

## Future Plans

I plan to improve website UI as well as make the code neater so that it becomes more readable and easy to work with!
